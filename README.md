# I am Sreelakshmi S

Building from Code to Conclusions.

I am currently developing a structured pathway into Data Analysis and Machine Learning, with a strong emphasis on fundamentals, reproducibility, and analytical thinking.

My learning approach is systematic — starting from core Python concepts and progressively moving toward applied data workflows.

---

## Learning Journey

I believe strong data work begins with strong programming foundations. My current roadmap includes:

- Mastering Python fundamentals
- Deepening understanding of data structures
- Practicing numerical computing with NumPy
- Performing structured data manipulation with Pandas
- Generating analytical insights through data visualisation
- Building forecasting workflows with proper validation strategies

---

## Key Projects

### From Code to Conclusions
A structured, notebook-based Python learning repository designed to move from basic syntax to analytical reasoning using real datasets.

Focus areas:
- Modular concept notebooks
- Practice-driven exercises
- Transition from programming to analysis

### Public Distribution System (PDS) Forecasting
An end-to-end data science project involving:
- State-level aggregation
- Anomaly-aware exploratory data analysis
- Lag-based feature engineering
- Recursive forecasting reconstruction
- Streamlit application development

This project strengthened my understanding of:
- Feature leakage risks
- Time-based validation
- Model pipeline coherence
- Reproducible data workflows
